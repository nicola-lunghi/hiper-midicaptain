Starting from Supermode 4.0 and later versions, we no longer store numerous wallpapers in the wallpaper directory.
This approach helps save time in program updates and reduces the risk of errors. If you want to change the wallpaper,
you can directly copy wallpapers from the original program package or your custom-made wallpapers to the directory,
rename them as wp1, and replace the default wallpaper.
We will also provide more curated wallpapers on our official website for users to download.
